# Tan Xuan Zhao’s Artifical Intelligence (AI), Data Science and Machine Learning Portfoilo

Hi, I am Xuan Zhao and this is my Artifical Intelligence (AI), Data Science and Machine Learning Portfoilo.

## Facial Recognition - A Deep Learning Approach
Research related to improving facial recognition models

Final Year (Capstone) Project, University Of Wollongong, October 2023 – March 2024

The original Model uses MTCNN which has been modified to make it easier for me to test the modification of activation functions of the CNN layers. I modified from an existing model to test how the modification of activation fuctions such as LeakReLU, SoftMax, Sigmoid and how it would affect the Accuracy, Precision, Recall and Response time of the code, choosing the best model at the end of all the tests.\
